    <section>Personal Information</section>
        <p>Born and raised in Australia, my parents moved to Australia from Vietnam before I was born so growing up was a little hard due to the fact that they didn't know english. I am half vietnamese (both parents were both raised in Vietnam) and half Australian but my main language that I use is english and even though im half viet i don't really speak vietnamese that much at the bare minimum when I use vietnamese is to just talk to my parents and cousins. Completed year 12 in 2016 and currently studying at RMIT. Currently what i like to do in my free time is to do plastic modelling about robots (scaled down) as a hobby. Even though I don't really like arts and crafts that much, I find enjoyment in this hobby maybe due to the fact as a child I found robots to be cool and amazing in a way that I can't really explain. </p>

    <section>Interest in IT</section>
        <p>Growing up my family had owned a PC and I believe this was the first point in my life where I found an interest in IT. I'm amazed by how IT has evolved over the past years and I'm intrigued to see how it will keep growing. Nowadays most people use IT in their daily lives as it helps people stay connected to other people, news, music and I find that amazing that it all started from a computer in 1978 that could only do complex calculations. The only IT experience I got was when I was studying in highschool where I had two classes on IT, one class was about software and the other was networking.</p>
        <p>I chose to study at RMIT university to develop a clear idea on what IT is and hoping to end up with a lifelong career in something IT related, But to do so i must learn the basics and gain enough knowledge about the job that i'm currently interested in which is networking. The reason I choose networking jobs over programming jobs is that I'm not really great at complex coding. From what I learned, networking has a wide amount of jobs and I haven't really decided which one is right for me.</p>
        <p>Right now I expect what I'm expecting to study is all the basics of IT for various careers that are IT related even programming which i dont i have a talent for. Also hope that by the end of my study I have learnt a new or few programming languages.I would also like to study things that i haven't done yet, such as create apps or develop simple software.</p>

    <section>Ideal Job</section>
        <p style="color:rgb(184, 49, 49);"><img src="img/job small ver.PNG" alt="Network & Systems Administrator" style="width:30%"><br>Image from Seek</p>
        <p>In this job you deal with installing, upgrading/replacing hardware,software and networks to make organizing that you're working for better. Their goal is to have the company to continue running and if an issue does occur they have to fix it. I believe a network and systems administrator is someone who keeps and maintains the servers online at all times and must keep it running. Also keep hardware functional as well. They also do things like a desk support for computers. The skills that I believe are required for this job are networking (cisco), cyber security and computer or information science. Most companies  ask to require a bachelor’s degree, but some others may require only a postsecondary certificate or an associate’s degree. Back in 2018 I studied a bit in networking at Swinburne University but sadly dropped out due to personal issues. Complete my studies in networking (but first this IT course) and also pick up some other networking related certificates such as cyber security. Then hope I can land a job where it's basic networking first then climb my way up further with the experience that I gained. </p>

        <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
            <img src="img/16personalities.PNG" alt="16 Personality" style="width:15%">
            <p>First, I would like to point out that this test has a pretty accurate result about me. I work better alone than with others, maybe due to the fact I’m kinda introverted (61%) and  feel like I may drag them behind because of me so working alone is better, as it shows with my feeling (60%). I’m also not the type to lead not really fond of leading (turbulent [69%]). With these results I may work better as someone who plays the following role in a team, not the leading role and that might make it easier to collaborate with other members of the team. It also can show that I could be someone who helps my teammates out when in need. When forming a team I hope that my teammates are similar to me because if we all support each other we may be able to get through any difficulty that arises.</p>

        <h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
            <img src="img/educationplanner.PNG" alt="Education Planner" style="width:37%">
            <p>The results for my learning style test is that I'm a hand on person, who learns better when doing something with physical movement to learn. I don’t think that the results came out how i expected, i thought i will be more visual learner than tactile and last being an auditory learner. This may influence my behaviour in a team because with the results of the test I would have  a team meetup face to face instead of it being online. When forming a team I hope the team I’m with is living around the state so it's possible for us to meet up.</p>

        <h3>Extra Test</h3>
            <img src="img/careerexplorer.PNG" alt="Career Explorer" style="width:40%" >
            <p>This test was about careers but some of the characteristics seem right about me.  I didn't expect that the results of the test would show the things that I had an interest in and I'm glad how my results are, I guess that comes to show that my personality works well with the career that I seek for. In the results it said that I was straight forward so when it comes to working in a team I might provide constructive criticism to my fellow teammates. When forming a team I hope my teammates are okay with me being straightforward and not take the things I say as a insult cause that will affect the team.</p>

    <section>Project Idea</section>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
         <p>Augmented reality or AR (for short) technology has seen remarkable growth into today's tech world and it is currently getting expanding its growth. The google definition of augmented reality is “a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view”. My project idea deals with AR and how I believe that AR is the next step forward. AR does have many uses but it could be used in a new way to talk or to watch someone dance/sing. For example if you had booked a concert and couldn't make it live, you could watch an AR version to experience it through your smart device. Another way to use AR would be to have it scan a model/object (literally anything) and upload a 3D model copy of itself, this can be helpful when buying something like furniture and not being so sure if it will fit where you have intended it to be. The targeted audience is for everyone, because this is used in a class, work, social and party environment, the only limitation i could think is people who don't have the technology or people who don't understand how to use it.</p>

         <h3>Motivation</h3>
         <p>A great example or AR being used is Pokemon Go where the whole game is an augmented reality mobile game, and back in 2016 the game had more than a 500 millions downloads. As i have stated before that AR is growing technology and it said in some statistics that AR will continue to grow over the past few years. According to MarketsandMarkets back in 2019 the AR market is worth $10.7 billion USD and is expected to grow and reach $72.7 billion USD by 2024, they also note that the CAGR will grow to at a 46.6% from 2019 to 2014. Many companies are heavily invested into the AR market such as Facebook Corporation, Intel Corporation, Qualcomm, Inc., Alphabet, Inc., Comcast Ventures, and Samsung Group. Apple rumored product the Apple glasses may be AR smart glasses. I believe that the world of tech is moving towards augmented reality and it would be interesting to see how it would end up being used in society and how it may change the world.</p>

         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p>My project idea is to expand what AR could do at the moment. The product itself might be a camera with a wireless mic and an app will accompany the product to utilise the features. Also note some features may require VR. Most people in today's society are using some type of smart device, and as long as it has a camera and compatible specs it may be able use AR features and that means that they could use features of my products and services. My project idea can do more than one thing as it can expand depending on new ideas that come to mind. At best people currently use AR just to change your face with a filter or have a model to replace their face/body or use AR to see what the measurement of a 3D scanned object is. Also some apps/games on smartphones use/require AR technology to work/play.</p>

         <p>The main feature of my services is that it enables the user to do social AR where people can talk to each other using either their real face or an made up avatar at any time and anywhere. Similar to how apple use memoji when using your face camera to talk to other people but full body instead. Avatars are created by the users when used to chat.  It would be able to capture not only face movements but body movement as well depending if the user allows it, the reason I added this in is because body language can help improve conversation. I believe the user completely utilises this feature if they own some type of smart glasses. I can also see this being used when students have online classes, where face cameras are required and students are using created avatars. By doing this some people won't be so shy about webcamming and this may make the class more interactable.</p>

         <p>To further expand on my product or service Virtual Reality (VR for short) could be used to improve my services. My services can also provide a live concert that has been done completely digitally (digital concert), so instead of watching the concert from a 2D perspective users can watch it through augmented reality making it more 3D like and can make the concert exceptionally more immersive that way, the reason for this idea included was due to covid-19 most people had to watch concerts over the net and people online including myself didn't find it worth the price to watch online so making it an AR and VR experience could make it more enchanting to watch.</p>

         <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
         <p>The hardware that the users require are a computer or smartphone but mostly this whole project was for users to use it using their smartphones. Currently most smartphones nowadays have the technology to use AR so any other products would only be an addition to enchant the experience, such as the camera which can be required if the user is on the pc. On the smartphone it would be used through an app and on pc it would have a software. The open source tools that are used are camera related ones, though i'm not really sure which one to use as of yet.</p>

         <h3>Skills Required</h3>
         <p>The skills that require to make project work is to have developed an app and software to use with a camera. The additional camera could come down as a special hardware that has to be built. I believe that this project is pretty feasible as it doesn't really require much.</p>

         <h3>Outcome</h3>
         <p>If the project is successful I believe that AR would become more popular and be used more often in today's society.In the end the project was just to improve on something not develop something that will change the world but I can see that it will help connect with each other better.</p>
